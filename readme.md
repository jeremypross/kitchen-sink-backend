# Kitchen Sink App

## Idea:
The concept behind this app is that everyone runs into a situation at home where they have limited ingredients and need inspiration for what to cook.  This app solves that problem by allowing users to input their ingredients on hand, and see search results of recipes which include those search parameters.
